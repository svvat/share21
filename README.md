## Description

This is a prototype React / Typescript application with material ui. Due to time constrainsts it wasnt completed. As I am 
more a back end developer than front end, it may appear clumsy. 

## Functionality Included

1. User logs in with username: user01 and password : password01
2. User cannot log in with an unknown / incorrect credentials
3. On logging in the user is presented with a home page with 4 options. Only the Profile Opion is functional
4. Clicking Profile [username] button, presents a read only view of the profile details with 2 buttons Edit & Cancel
5. Cancel will take the user to the previous screen
6. Edit will permit editing of the profile data and will show a Save button. The Save button is disabled until a change is mage

**NB.** The application does not save the data.

## Instructions

`npm run build`
`npm run start`
